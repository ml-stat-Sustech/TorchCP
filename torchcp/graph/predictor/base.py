    Abstract base class for all conformal predictors designed for graph data.

    This class serves as a base for implementing conformal prediction algorithms 
    in the context of graph-structured data. It extends the functionality of 
    `BasePredictor` and incorporates additional methods and properties 
    specific to graph prediction tasks.

        graph_data (torch_geometric.data.Data): 
            The input graph data in PyG format.
        score_function (callable): 
            A user-defined function that computes the non-conformity score.
        model (torch.nn.Module): 
            A PyTorch model used for predictions on the graph. Defaults to `None`.
